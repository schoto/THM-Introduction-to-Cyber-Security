While offensive security is focused on breaking into system (attacks) the deffensive security does the opposite. 
It prevents the attacks and helps to find "holes" in the system. It also detects the intrusions
The team of deffensive security is called BLUE TEAM
Some of their tasks include :
<ul>
<li>user cyber security awareness</li>
<li>documenting and managing assets</li>
<li>updating, patching and fixing systems</li>
<li>setting up preventative security devices</li>
<li>setting up logging and monitoring devices</li>
</ul>
