The content discusses web applications and their functionality. 
It explains that web applications can be accessed without installation through web browsers like Firefox, Safari, or Chrome. 
Examples of web applications include webmail services, online office suites, and online shopping sites. 
The article also touches on the security aspects of web applications, such as bug bounty programs and common security risks 
like identification and authentication failure, broken access control, injection, and cryptographic failures.

In terms of security risks, if a login page allows an unlimited number of login attempts without slowing down the user or locking the account, 
it falls under the category of "Identification and Authentication Failure." 
When the username and password are sent in cleartext without encryption, it's also a security risk falling under the same category.

The article later discusses Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) as a type of Broken Access Control vulnerability.
It explains that attackers can access information or perform actions not intended for them by manipulating input data.

Finally, the content describes an exercise where users need to identify the user account used to make malicious changes, 
revert those changes, and obtain a flag as a result of their actions.

In summary, the content provides insights into web applications, their security risks, 
and a practical exercise related to IDOR vulnerabilities.


This content discusses web applications and security risks associated with them. 
Web applications can be used without installation, provided you have a modern web browser. 
They include webmail, online office suites, and online shopping sites. 
Security risks include unlimited login attempts (Identification and Authentication Failure), 
sending sensitive data without encryption (Cryptographic Failures), 
and Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) leading to unauthorized access.

To answer your questions:
1. Unlimited login attempts without slowing down or locking the account 
falls under the category of "Identification and Authentication Failure" security risk.
2. Sending usernames and passwords in cleartext without encryption is also a "Cryptographic Failures" security risk.
3. To discover which user account made malicious changes in the IDOR scenario, you need to check other users' accounts. 
After reverting the changes, the flag you receive is not specified in the provided content.
